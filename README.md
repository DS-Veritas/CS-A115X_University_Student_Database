## CS-A115X_University_Student_Database
A SQL project for the course Databases (CS-A1153). The database contains information of individual student, course, lecture, exercise session and et cetera. 

### Documents
[Final Report](Project_Part2_Document.pdf)

### Introduction
The purpose of the project is to learn to design databases in practice. The project consists of two parts. In the first part, we are asked to design a database using UML and define the relations based on the diagram. In the second part, we are asked to implement the database (using SQL) we designed in the first part. And then test our database in sQLiteStudio environment. 

### Tasks
- Define the relation schema in SQL. The schema must contain the same information as the project part 1. Write the CREATE statements to the document. Use data types that are reasonable. Justify solutions. In addition, insert enough initial data into tables such that it can test the SQL queries described below.
- Check the keys and other constraints in the database. Verify that the primary keys and foreign keys are well defined.
- Which kind of SQL queries might be typical for the database? Create reasonable indexing which supports the purposeful use of the database. In addition, add at least one useful view definition to the database.
- Create some typical use cases for the database. Write a description of the use case, explain which information needs to be selected/updated/inserted and write the SQL queries and possible other commands that are needed to fulfill the use case. The number of SQL queries (SQL statements which begin with the word SELECT and end with semicolon) written in the document must be at least 15. (One use case may contain several queries.) Try to find at least one use case where little bit more complicated SQL query is required, for example including join of several tables, grouping and calculating a value of an aggerate function. In addition to queries, many of the use cases probably need other SQL commands, like inserts or deletes.
- Run the SQL statements (creating the tables, inserting example data in them and the SQL queries) in SQLiteStudio environment.
