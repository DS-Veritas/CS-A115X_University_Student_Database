## CS-A115X_University_Student_Database
A SQL project for the course Databases (CS-A1153). The database contains information of individual student, course, lecture, exercise session and et cetera. 

### Documents
[Final Report](Project_Part2_Document.pdf)

### Introduction
The purpose of the project is to learn to design databases in practice. The project consists of two parts.
In this part, you are asked to design a database using UML and define the relations based on the
diagram. In the second part, you will implement the database (using SQL) you designed in this part

### Research Questions
- What are the predictors significantly affecting students’ performance
- How can we predict the student’s academic performance based on these predictors?
- How accurate can we predict the outcome with the regression models? 

### Data Description
The data was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning database. The data approach student achievement in secondary educatio
n of two Portuguese schools: Gabriel Pereira HS and Mousinho da Silveira HS. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The questionnaires were answered by 788 students, in total, and 111 answers were discarded due to lack of identification to merge with the mark reports. The data was then integrated into two different datasets: Mathematics (mat) with 395 observations and Portuguese language (por) with 649 observations.
